# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The system is built using Python and utilizes collaborative filtering based on item similarity to provide personalized movie recommendations to users.

Key Features:
1. Dependency Management: The project provides clear instructions for installing the required dependencies (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy) using pip, ensuring a smooth setup process.
2. Dataset Integration: Users are guided to download the MovieLens dataset from the official website and place the necessary CSV files (ratings.csv and movies.csv) in the project directory.
3. User-Friendly: The usage instructions are straightforward, allowing users to clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the Python script with ease.
4. Data Preprocessing: The script handles data preprocessing by merging the ratings and movies datasets, removing unnecessary columns, and preparing the data for further analysis.
5. User-Item Matrix Creation: A pivotal step in collaborative filtering, the project creates a user-item matrix, making it easier to compute recommendations based on user preferences.
6. Data Splitting: The dataset is split into a training set and a testing set, following an 80:20 ratio. This ensures the model can be evaluated for its effectiveness.
7. Item Similarity Calculation: The script calculates item-item similarity using cosine similarity, a commonly used metric in recommendation systems. It adjusts the similarity matrix to exclude self-similarity (diagonal elements).
8. Recommendation Generation: The system provides a user-friendly function, get_recommendations(), which accepts a user ID as input and returns the top N recommended movies based on item similarity.
9. Customization: Users can potentially extend and customize the project for their own datasets or use cases, making it a flexible tool for building recommendation systems.
