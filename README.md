# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The system is built using Python and utilizes collaborative filtering based on item similarity to provide personalized movie recommendations to users.

Dependencies:
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
1. pandas
2. scikit-learn
3. numpy

You can install them using pip:
```
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

Dataset:
The MovieLens dataset is used for this recommendation system. You can download the dataset from the official MovieLens website (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). The `ratings.csv` and `movies.csv` files are required.

Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
```
2. Place the `ratings.csv` and `movies.csv` files in the project directory.
3. Run the Python script:
```
python recommendation_system.py
```
4. Enter a user ID when prompted to get movie recommendations for that user.

Implementation Details
1. The `recommendation_system.py` script loads the `ratings.csv` and `movies.csv` files and performs the following steps:
2. Data Preprocessing:
   - The script merges the ratings and movies data on the `movieId` column.
   - Unnecessary columns such as `timestamp` and `genres` are dropped.
3. Creating User-Item Matrix:
   - A pivot table is created using `userId` as rows and `movieId` as columns.
4. Splitting the Data:
   - The dataset is split into a training set and a testing set using a 80:20 ratio.
5. Calculating Item Similarity:
   - Item-item similarity is calculated using cosine similarity.
   - Diagonal elements of the similarity matrix are set to 0 to avoid self-similarity.
6. Making Recommendations:
   - The `get_recommendations()` function takes a user ID as input and returns the top N recommended movies based on item similarity.
7. The user can input a user ID, and the script will display the recommended movies for that user.
